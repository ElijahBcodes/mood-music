- $ `rails webpacker:install:react`
- $ `yarn add @babel/preset-react`
- $ `yarn add @rails/activestorage`
- $ `yarn add @rails/ujs`

### React Setup
- $ `rails generate react:install`
- $ `rails generate react:component App`
   - Replaced boilerplate Ruby App component to arrow function App
- $ `rails generate controller Home index`
   - In **app/views/layouts/application.html.erb**:
   ```javascript
   // Find this line:
   <%= javascript_importmap_tags %>

   // And replace it with this:
   <%= javascript_pack_tag 'application', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %>
   ```

### Add Reactstrap and React Router

- $ `yarn add react-router-dom`
   - In **config/routes.rb**:
   ```ruby
   Rails.application.routes.draw do
      get '*path', to: 'home#index', constraints: ->(request){ request.format.html? }
      root 'home#index'
   end
   ```

### Add Devise
- $ `bundle add devise`
- $ `rails generate devise:install`
- $ `rails generate devise User`

### Database Schemas and Seeds

   - user has_many songs, songs belong_to user
- Migration to add user_id column to songs
- Create a seeds file of songs

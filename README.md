# ðŸŽ¶ MÃ¼d MÃ¼zik ðŸŽ¶
Welcome to MÃ¼d MÃ¼zik! With all the choices you make throughout the day, let us reduce your decision fatigue by picking out great music depending on your mood. Whether you are looking to study, workout, rock or just chill, MÃ¼d MÃ¼zik will curate your listening experience. Choose the mood you're in, and we'll give you a playlist of songs that you can listen to! Our app is user friendly and customizable, allowing you to pick mood playlists, add new songs to the playlist, and listen to quality audio based on your preferences.

## About Our Project
MÃ¼d MÃ¼zik is a website application made using React IN Rails for our capstone project at LEARN Academy! As music lovers, our team decided to create a music application where you can find new songs based on what mood you're in. Users can create an account through the Ruby Devise gem and perform basic CRUD actions with songs. We've also implemented a media player so that when you find a song you want to listen to, you can listen to it right on our app!

## Cloning the Project Through Your Terminal

1. Clone the repository onto your computer
   - $ `git clone https://github.com/capstone-capos-2022-echo/mood-music.git`
2. Move into the app repository
   - $ `cd mood-music`
3. Setup your database
   - $ `rails db:setup`
4. Install the dependencies
   - $ `yarn`
   - $ `bundle`
5. Run the server
   - $ `rails server`
6. Open the app in your browser
   - $ `http://localhost:3000`

## Create Your Own React IN Rails App with Devise
These are the steps in the terminal we took in order to set up our app.

### Create the Rails App
- $ `rails new mood-music -d postgresql -T`
- $ `cd mood-music`
- $ `rails db:create`
- $ `bundle add rspec-rails`
- $ `rails g rspec:install`

### Add React to Rails
- $ `bundle add webpacker`
- $ `bundle add react-rails`
- $ `rails webpacker:install`
- $ `rails webpacker:install:react`
- $ `yarn add @babel/preset-react`
- $ `yarn add @rails/activestorage`
- $ `yarn add @rails/ujs`

### React Setup
- $ `rails generate react:install`
- $ `rails generate react:component App`
   - Replaced boilerplate Ruby App component to arrow function App
- $ `rails generate controller Home index`
   **app/views/layouts/application.html.erb**:
   ```javascript
   // Find this line:
   <%= javascript_importmap_tags %>

   // And replace it with this:
   <%= javascript_pack_tag 'application', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %>
   ```

### Add Reactstrap and React Router
- $ `bundle add bootstrap`
- $ `mv app/assets/stylesheets/application.css app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss`
- $ `yarn add reactstrap`

- $ `yarn add react-router-dom`
   **config/routes.rb**:
   ```ruby
   Rails.application.routes.draw do
      get '*path', to: 'home#index', constraints: ->(request){ request.format.html? }
      root 'home#index'
   end
   ```

### Add Devise
- $ `bundle add devise`
- $ `rails generate devise:install`
- $ `rails generate devise User`
- $ `rails db:migrate`

### Database Schemas and Seeds
- Generate a resource for Song (you can choose your own database and columns):
   - $ `rails g resource Song title:string artist:string album:string mood:string album_art:text song_link:text`
- Make active record associations between User and Song models
   - user has_many songs, songs belong_to user
- Migration to add user_id column to songs
- Create a seeds file of songs

## Icebox Ideas
- Users can favorite songs and see a list of their favorites
- Have an additional media player for the MoodSongIndex.js page (playlist)
- Create an administrative account to manage songs that users want to add to the database
- Add warnings and error messages when trying to create and update songs, and creating a new user
- Implement a Spotify API to gather song data
